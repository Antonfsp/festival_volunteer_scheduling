# festival_volunteer_scheduling
This is a personal project which aims to create an application for automathic
scheduling of volunteers in a (music) festival.

The idea came to me after listen the complains that several friends, who have
signed up as volunteers for a festival, had about the personal schedules which
have been assigned to them.
