---- This application must be usable for any music festival willing to automate
the task of create the timetables for their volunteers. Therefore, it has to be
:
    - Customizable.
    - User friendly.
    - The scheduling algorithm has to be "relatibly" fast.

---- The input for the application would be:

    - The festival characteristics, i.e. :
            - Number of days of the festival.
            - Time slots of each day, tasks to be done in each time slot and how
            many volunteers in each time slot and task (minimum and desired
            number of volunteers).
            - The number of recruted of volunteers.
            - Some decisions about what is a feasible timetable must be let to
            decision of the festival managers, i.e. : volunteers can be assigned to
            time slots of unvailable days ? or to undersired tasks and time
            slots ?

    - The preferences of each volunteer, i.e. :
            - Which days and time slots they are available.
            - Which tasks they would prefer to be assigned to. 
            - Which task they would prefer NOT to be assigned to.

---- The output must be a feasible timetable, where all the tasks-time slots get
assigned at least their minimum number of volunteers, and the preferences of the
volunteers are maximize.

---- A volunteer satisfaction-based algorithm which will try to maximize the
satisfaction of the whole volunteer crew without creating large differences
between the satisfaction level of the different volunteers.

---- The idea is to use a local-search metaheuristic algorithm.
